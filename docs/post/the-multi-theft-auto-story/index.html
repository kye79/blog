<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>The reason I&rsquo;m writing this blog post is because I want to put this MTA shit to rest <strong>once and for all</strong>&hellip;</p>

<p>I used to be a MTA developer, but I doubt you knew that.
Probably because those MTA cretins did not credit me anywhere in their project, even though I worked with them for a year and came up with the main sync method (player context switching) which is used by both mods.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-hate-multi-theft-auto">Why I hate Multi Theft Auto</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get one thing out of the way first, the MTA team are thieves.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s take a look at <a href="https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Animations">their animations list</a>. Notice how &ldquo;WOP&rdquo;, &ldquo;GFUNK&rdquo; and &ldquo;RUNNINGMAN&rdquo; are missing? They&rsquo;re missing because I removed them from my list, which MTA stole.</p>

<p>Or how about <a href="https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Skins_Page_13">this</a> (added two years after SA-MP).
Notice how all the ID&rsquo;s and names are the exact same, all of these skins were stolen from SA-MP&rsquo;s peds.ide.</p>

<pre><code>290,ROSE,ROSE

296,JIZZY,JIZZY
297,MADDOGG,MADDOGG
298,CAT,CAT
299,CLAUDE,CLAUDE
</code></pre>

<p>This is without discussing any of the things MTA servers lifted from SA-MP scripts.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that at this point MTA is a fucking game engine. It&rsquo;s just bloated with features. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I prefer my GTA:SA almost feature-less.</p>

<p>But that is just the tip of the iceberg&hellip;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s worse is the abuse the MTA team has put me through.</p>

<p>Sometimes I can still see the room they locked me inside of, dog cages and surgical tools all over the wall. They&rsquo;d visit me every couple of hours and tickle my asshole to make sure I was still alive. Which soon followed by a visit of a man who I presumed to be the leader of the MTA gang. He touched me in ways I had never been touched before.</p>

<p>I could sit here for hours listing the things they&rsquo;ve done to me, from torture to rape to making me write LUA code. The MTA team has left me with multiple permanent physical and mental scars.</p>

<p>After all of this, it&rsquo;s very hard for me to work on new SA-MP updates. Every time I write code I keep losing focus and all I can think about are those dark moments. I hope that kind of explains why 0.3DL took so long.</p>
