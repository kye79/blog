About a week ago I banned You(Them)tube from the SA-MP forums.
This begs the question… “Why?”

On August 6th Infowars was banned from Youtube. Shortly after Apple, Spotify and Facebook (Being the ass sniffers they are) banned Infowars as well.

What happened to freedom of speech? Why are these brainwashed social justice warriors so butt hurt about the truth? If I want to get my news and information from a legitimate source instead of the CNN fake news corporation. I should have the right to, but apparently all those Silicon Valley stuck ups disagree.

So I did what I had to do. Anyone who shares a Youtube video on the sa-mp forums will be banned.

Where can you upload videos now? Well, **_Twitch, xhamster, Steam, Streamable, xvideos_** and **_dailymotion_** are currently a few options. This list might change in the future though.

Let’s keep Infowars alive. Donate [here](https://www.infowars.com/donate/) if you’re not a butt hurt SJW.
