# Introduction

The reason I'm writing this blog post is because I want to put this MTA shit to rest **once and for all**...

I used to be a MTA developer, but I doubt you knew that.
Probably because those MTA cretins did not credit me anywhere in their project, even though I worked with them for a year and came up with the main sync method (player context switching) which is used by both mods.

## Why I hate Multi Theft Auto

Let's get one thing out of the way first, the MTA team are thieves.

For example, let's take a look at [their animations list](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Animations). Notice how "WOP", "GFUNK" and "RUNNINGMAN" are missing? They're missing because I removed them from my list, which MTA stole.

Or how about [this](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Skins_Page_13) (added two years after SA-MP).
Notice how all the ID's and names are the exact same, all of these skins were stolen from SA-MP's peds.ide.

296,JIZZY,JIZZY
297,MADDOGG,MADDOGG

```

This is without discussing any of the things MTA servers lifted from SA-MP scripts.

Let's not forget that at this point MTA is a fucking game engine. It's just bloated with features. I'm sorry, but I prefer my GTA:SA almost feature-less.

But that is just the tip of the iceberg...

What's worse is the abuse the MTA team has put me through.

Sometimes I can still see the room they locked me inside of, dog cages and surgical tools all over the wall. They'd visit me every couple of hours and tickle my asshole to make sure I was still alive. Which soon followed by a visit of a man who I presumed to be the leader of the MTA gang. He touched me in ways I had never been touched before.

I could sit here for hours listing the things they've done to me, from torture to rape to making me write LUA code. The MTA team has left me with multiple permanent physical and mental scars.

After all of this, it's very hard for me to work on new SA-MP updates. Every time I write code I keep losing focus and all I can think about are those dark moments. I hope that kind of explains why 0.3DL took so long.
